# ku5ic's Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are designed to set up a macOS system to my liking and provide a more efficient and pleasant terminal experience. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Use at your own risk!

## Prerequisites

These dotfiles are designed for macOS systems. Before installing, make sure your system is up to date and has Xcode command line tools installed:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

## Installation

You can install these dotfiles on a brand new macOS installation by either cloning the repository using Git or downloading it using curl.

### Option 1: Clone with Git

Clone the repository, and source the install script:

```bash

source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
