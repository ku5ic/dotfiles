description: Convert a structured review report into a peer-to-peer GitHub PR comment
argument-hint: [path to review report] [PR author username]
model: haiku
---

## Procedure

1. Get the project name: `!`project-name.sh``.
2. Parse $ARGUMENTS. If the first token resolves to an existing file, treat it as the report path and any remaining token as the PR author username. Otherwise treat the whole of $ARGUMENTS as the PR author username and leave the report path unset.
3. If no report path was resolved, use the latest one for this project: `ls -t ~/.claude/scratch/review-<project-name>-*.md | head -1`. If none exist, stop and ask for a path.
4. Read the review report. It follows the markdown-report skill format: a severity rubric (failure/warning/info), each finding with file, line, "What", "Why it matters", and "Fix".
5. Look for a PR number in the report's `Scope:` line, its filename, or body (patterns like `pr-123`, `PR #123`, `PR: 123`). If found, run `gh pr view <n> --json author,headRefOid`. Use `.author.login` as the auto-detected author and `.headRefOid` as the ref for links.
6. Resolve the repo slug: `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`. If this fails (no remote, no auth), fall back to plain backticked `path:line` text for every finding - no links - and say so at the top of the comment.
7. Resolve the ref for links: the PR's head sha from step 5 if a PR was found; otherwise the current commit, `git rev-parse HEAD`.
8. Pull the summary line and every failure/warning finding. Include an info finding only if it is a quick win or visibly affects code quality; drop the rest.
9. For each kept finding, decide actionable ("real bug", "worth fixing") vs. non-issue ("feel free to drop"), based on severity and the "Why it matters" text, not guesswork.
10. Resolve the @mention: an explicit username argument wins; otherwise the gh-detected PR author; otherwise `@author` as a placeholder, flagged as needing a fill-in.

## Building file links

For every finding, build a real link instead of relying on GitHub to auto-linkify bare text - auto-linkify only works for paths that are relative to the repo root and present at the linked ref, so it silently fails for absolute paths or paths copied from a report generated in a different working directory.

1. Resolve the finding's path to one relative to the repo root: strip any absolute prefix that falls inside the working tree (e.g. `/Users/x/project/src/y.ts` inside repo `project` becomes `src/y.ts`). This covers "outside of repo" references the same way as already-relative ones - there is only one link-building path, not a special case.
2. If a single line: `https://github.com/<repo-slug>/blob/<ref>/<relative-path>#L<line>`. If a range `a-b`: `#La-Lb`. If the location is a non-numeric region (e.g. "constructor"), link to the file with no line anchor and keep the region name as text.
3. If the path cannot be resolved inside the repo at all (points to something genuinely outside this working tree), keep it as backticked `path:line` text with no link, and flag it as unresolved rather than guessing a URL.
4. Skip this entirely if step 6 could not resolve a repo slug.

## Output file

Write to `~/.claude/scratch/review-comment-<project-name>-<scope-slug>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.md`. Print the path. `<scope-slug>` comes from the input report's `Scope:` line if present, otherwise from the input filename.

Structure (GitHub markdown, no frontmatter, no metadata - copy-paste ready as a single PR comment):

```
Hey @<author>, <genuine one-line compliment about the work>.

<1-3 actionable issues, each as:>
- [path:line](link) - plain-language description of the problem, framed as "this one's a real bug" or "worth fixing".

<Non-issues, if any, framed as "feel free to drop this one" - grouped separately from the actionable issues, not interleaved.>

<Closing: a concrete next step or an open question. Never "let me know if you have questions".>
```

## Rules

- Tone: peer to peer, professional, warm. Never "I recommend" or "you should".
- Every finding link points at the exact line(s) from the source report, unedited.
- Skip info-level findings unless they are quick wins or visibly affect code quality.
- Keep the comment under 500 words. If the report has more findings than fit, split into multiple comments in the same output file, each in its own fenced block, labeled "Comment 1 of N" etc.
- Describe the problem and point at the fix; do not rewrite the actual code fix.
- Do not re-run the review or invent findings not present in the source report.
- No AI tells: no "I recommend", "it's worth noting", "let me know if you have questions".
- The latest-report fallback in step 3 only ever searches this project's own reports (`review-<project-name>-*`); never fall back to another project's file.
- If the resolved input file does not exist or does not match the markdown-report format, say so and stop.
