# Resolves the plans directory for the current context: project-scoped when
# project-root.sh finds a real anchor (git worktree or stack sentinel), global
# fallback otherwise. Sibling of scratch-dir.sh; see claude/rules/tooling.md
# section 3 for the three-directory split under a project's .claude/.
#
# Unlike scratch-dir.sh this registers nothing in scratch-registry.txt: plan
# files are not on scratch-rotate.sh's prune. They accumulate until cleared by
# hand, which is the point - a plan outlives the 30-day scratch window.
#
# Creates the directory if missing, for the same reason scratch-dir.sh does:
# a caller using a bare `>` redirect has no other chance to mkdir first.
