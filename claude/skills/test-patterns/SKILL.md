name: test-patterns
description: Testing conventions - test design, fixtures, mocking, query priority, async handling, behavior-vs-implementation tests, boundary coverage, and what to skip. Use whenever the project contains a test config file (`vitest.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`) or a test directory (`tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`), OR the user asks about tests at any level, mocking, fixtures, coverage, or a failing test, in any stack and even if a framework is not named.

# Test patterns

Apply the runner-specific reference matching the detected test runner. Principles apply to all stacks.
