description: WCAG 2.2 AA audit checklist, severity rubric, and stack adaptation for accessibility review. Use whenever the project contains UI code (`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, HTML files, Django templates), OR the user asks about accessibility, a11y, WCAG, screen readers, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA, contrast, semantic HTML, alt text, form labels, or audits a component, page, or template for accessibility issues regardless of stack, even if WCAG is not mentioned by name.

# WCAG 2.2 AA audit

Target: WCAG 2.2 Level AA. Includes all Level A. Does not include AAA unless explicitly requested.

## How to apply

Go through the references in order. Skip criteria that do not apply to the scope (e.g. no forms -> skip form labeling). Record what was checked, what passed, what failed. Note items that require runtime or user testing.

## Severity rubric

- `failure`: a direct Level AA violation that will block certification or cause a usable defect.
- `warning`: likely to cause issues in some assistive tech configurations, or violates A level and relied on by AA.
- `info`: best practice not required at AA, or a pattern likely to regress if not fixed now.

## When to load this skill

- The project contains UI code (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte, HTML, Django templates).
- The user asks about accessibility, a11y, WCAG, screen readers, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA, contrast, semantic HTML, alt text, form labels.
- Auditing a component, page, or template for accessibility issues.

## When not to load this skill

- Pure backend / data work with no rendered UI.
- Build / tooling changes that do not touch UI markup.

## Maintenance note

WCAG evolves: WCAG 3 is in early-draft form at the time of writing and will not replace WCAG 2.2 conformance until after a long sunset period. APCA contrast research continues outside the W3C; treat any "use APCA instead of WCAG ratio" claim as out of scope until the W3C ships normative guidance. When the W3C publishes a new WCAG version, reconcile this skill against the per-criterion Understanding pages.
