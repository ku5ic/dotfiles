description: Check reference skills against the current language or framework release and update their guidance, keeping a capped history of prior versions

## What this maintains

Reference skills are every `skills/*/SKILL.md` not prefixed `flow-`, `audit-`, `write-`, or `meta-`. Each carries a `## Version notes` section that this skill owns:

```
## Version notes

Checked: <YYYY-MM-DD> against <source: library id or URL>

- <version> (<release date>): <what changed for the guidance in this skill>
- <older version>: ...
```

Retention: at most 3 version entries, newest first. A pattern that changed moves into a `### Legacy (<version>)` block at the end of the reference file it came from, one short paragraph, at most 2 legacy blocks per file. Anything older is deleted with a one-line note "Older guidance removed <date>; see git history." Git holds the rest.

## Procedure

1. Scope. Get the scratch directory: `!`scratch-dir.sh``. The arguments are: $ARGUMENTS
   - One or more skill names: refresh those.
   - `--all`: every reference skill.
   - Blank: list every reference skill with its `Checked:` date (or "never"), oldest first, and ask which to refresh via AskUserQuestion (multi-select, at most 5 unless the user picks `--all`).
2. Read each selected skill's SKILL.md and every file under its `reference/`. Extract: the claimed current version (intro lines and Version notes), every version-specific claim ("since 3.4", "renamed in 16", "deprecated"), and the References URLs.
3. Research, never from memory. For each skill dispatch one researcher agent (Agent tool, subagent_type: researcher, same message for up to 3 at a time) with: the library or framework name, the References URLs, the claimed current version, and the list of version-specific claims. Ask it to return, with a source for each:
   - Latest stable version and its release date; latest LTS if the ecosystem has one.
   - Each claim: verified / contradicted (with the current wording) / could not verify.
   - New deprecations or renames since the claimed version.
   - New official best-practice guidance that changes what this skill recommends. Official docs and release notes only; blog posts do not count.
4. Classify each skill:
   - `current`: version matches, no contradicted claims. Update only the `Checked:` line.
   - `version bump`: newer release, no guidance change. Add a Version notes entry; update the intro's default-version line.
   - `guidance changed`: at least one contradicted claim or new deprecation. Apply step 5.
   - `could not verify`: researcher had no source. Change nothing; report it.
5. Apply guidance changes, one reference file at a time:
   - Replace the outdated pattern with the current one where it lives.
   - Move the old pattern to `### Legacy (<version>)` at the end of that file, one paragraph stating what changed and when it still applies (projects pinned to the old major).
   - Enforce the caps from "What this maintains". Prune oldest first.
   - Add the Version notes entry naming the source URL or library id from step 3.
   - Do not touch guidance the research did not contradict. Do not delete a reference file. Do not reword for style.
6. Report. Write `$(scratch-dir.sh)/refresh-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.md` in the `rules/markdown-report.md` format:
   - Summary: skills checked, per-classification counts.
   - One finding per `guidance changed` skill: severity `warning`, what changed, files edited, source.
   - One finding per `version bump`: severity `info`.
   - "Cannot be verified statically": every `could not verify` item with what a manual check needs.
     Print the path.

## Rules

- A claim the researcher could not source stays as it was. "Could not verify" is a valid outcome; a confident edit from training memory is not (`rules/evidence.md`).
- Every Version notes entry cites its source. An entry without one is a defect.
- Prefer the smallest edit that makes the guidance true. Rewriting a reference file is out of scope; propose it in the report instead.
- engineering-fundamentals is exempt: its sources move on a multi-decade cycle. Refresh it only when named explicitly.
- Stop after the report. Do not commit.

## Stop conditions

- Researcher agent unavailable (no Context7, no network): stop and say so.
- A skill has no References URLs and no library the researcher can resolve: report it as unverifiable and move on.
- More than 5 skills selected without `--all`: ask before continuing.
