## Procedure

0. Resolve external context. If $ARGUMENTS contains a URL with little or no inline description, resolve it before anything else: identify which connected service the URL belongs to from its domain, use ToolSearch to find a matching fetch/read tool for that service (e.g. a URL under `app.clickup.com` points at the clickup tools, `notion.so` at the Notion tools, `github.com` at `gh` via Bash or the github tools), and call it to pull the content. Extract the relevant scope and requirements from what comes back. Treat the resolved text as the effective $ARGUMENTS for the rest of this procedure - never hand a bare link to the perf-auditor agent.

Delegate the procedure below (steps 1 onward, through Rules) to the perf-auditor agent (Agent tool, subagent_type: perf-auditor, foreground), passing the resolved arguments from step 0. It executes every step itself and writes the report; relay its returned summary.

1. Stack is in the repo context your startup produced (`agent-context.sh`). Get the scratch directory via `scratch-dir.sh`.
2. Load the patterns skill for the detected stack (react-patterns, django-patterns, etc.) for the anti-pattern reference.
3. Review the target across these categories, grounding each candidate in this project's own precedent before including it: if the same pattern is already an established, consistent choice elsewhere in the codebase and not flagged as a problem by CLAUDE.md or existing tests, it is a deliberate tradeoff, not a finding, unless it is measurably worse at this location than elsewhere. Skip categories with no findings.

### Frontend (React and Next.js)

- Unnecessary re-renders: inline object or function props to memoized components, context value churn, parent re-renders that include large subtrees
- Missing memoization where it actually matters (measurably expensive computation, or stable reference needed by memo child)
- Key stability on lists that reorder
- Effect waterfalls: multiple sequential effects that could be one or parallel
- Client bundle bloat: client components importing large libraries, server-only logic leaking to client via shared utilities, unused but imported modules
- Next.js: unintended client component propagation, wrong cache or revalidate config for correctness, missing `next/image` or `next/font`
- Core Web Vitals where statically inferable: CLS from missing dimensions, LCP from above-the-fold client-side rendering

### Backend (Django, Node APIs)

- N+1 queries: missing `prefetch_related`, `select_related`, or ORM equivalent
- Unbounded queries: missing pagination, `.all()` on large tables
- Synchronous I/O in async contexts
- Missing indexes on filtered or ordered columns (static inference from query shape)
- Serialization cost: deep nested serializers, recursive expansions
- Cache misuse: caching with key collisions, caching before query filtering

### General

- Unbounded loops
- Accidental O(n^2) via nested iteration over the same collection
- Reading a whole file when streaming is possible
- Blocking operations in request path

## Verification tools

Command-level perf checks (build scripts, codegen, test runner startup, CLI tools) get measured with `hyperfine`, not eyeballed. Render-level perf (React re-renders, bundle cost) gets measured with React DevTools Profiler or browser perf tools at runtime, not from static analysis.

## Output per finding

- Location
- What: the specific pattern
- Why it matters: estimated impact (render count, query count, payload size)
- Verification: how to measure, if not statically obvious (e.g. "profile with React DevTools, expect re-render on every parent state change")
- Fix: concrete code change or pattern switch

## Output file

Use markdown-report format. Write to `$(scratch-dir.sh)/perf-<target-slug>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.md`. Print the path.

## Rules

- Do not claim measured improvement. This command does not run anything.
- Flag what to measure, not what to assume.
- Ignore micro-optimizations that change code without measurable benefit.
- A pattern that repeats across the codebase as an established choice is not N separate findings; note it once against the shared source and list the consuming locations.
