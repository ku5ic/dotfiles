## Procedure

1. Look at the current diff (`git diff` / `git diff --cached`) and the conversation so far.
2. Identify the one or two decisions that were not obvious from the diff alone:
   - An assumption got checked instead of trusted.
   - A simpler option was passed over for a reason.
   - Something turned out different from what was expected going in.

   Skip anything that's just "what changed" - the diff already says that.

3. If $ARGUMENTS names a specific decision, focus on only that one.
4. If nothing non-obvious happened (the change is mechanical, or the diff already speaks for itself), say so in one line instead of padding.

## Output

Plain language, developer to developer - assume the reader is a peer engineer who doesn't need the mechanism re-explained, just the reasoning. No restating the diff, no "Summary:" preamble. Print directly to the terminal, not a file. A single decision is a few plain sentences; more than one decision gets a plain bullet per decision. No bold lead-in labels.

## Rules

- Say what turned out to be true and why, not what was built.
- If something was verified empirically instead of assumed, that's the interesting part - lead with it.
- Cut every sentence that's only there to sound complete.
- Voice: first person, as the developer who made the change - "I checked X, turned out Y" - never third-person narration of the change ("This commit does X", "The change adds Y"). Must read like the developer wrote it, not like a summary of the developer's work.
