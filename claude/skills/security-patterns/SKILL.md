description: Security checklist covering XSS, injection, authentication, authorization, sessions, CSRF, CSP, secrets, dependency CVEs, input validation, and severity calls. Use whenever the project includes auth code, session handling, environment variable reads, user input handling, route handlers, server actions, middleware, or external API calls, OR the user asks about security, hardening, vulnerabilities, auth, authentication, authorization, sessions, cookies, XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, secrets, environment variables, CSP, headers, or reviews changes that touch user input, auth, or external data, even if "security" is not mentioned by name.

# Security patterns

Apply the references that match the detected stack. Severity rubric below applies cross-cuttingly.

## Severity rubric

- `failure`: exploitable, or direct leak of credentials, or missing CSRF on authenticated mutating endpoint.
- `warning`: mitigated but weak (e.g. CSP present but with `unsafe-inline`), or pattern that will become exploitable if misused.
- `info`: hardening opportunity, not currently exploitable.

## When to load this skill

- The project includes auth code, session handling, env-var reads, user-input handling, route handlers, server actions, middleware, or external API calls.
- The user asks about security, hardening, vulnerabilities, auth, sessions, cookies, XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, secrets, env variables, CSP, headers.
- Reviewing changes that touch user input, auth, or external data.

## When not to load this skill

- Pure presentational changes that touch no input boundary, no auth path, no external call.
- Style-only edits (CSS, formatting, copy changes).

## Maintenance note

Web security best practices evolve as browsers ship new headers, new threat classes emerge, and OWASP updates the Cheat Sheet Series. Reconcile this skill against the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series and MDN Web Security at least once a year, and on any significant browser release that changes default cookie or fetch semantics.
