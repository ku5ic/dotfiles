description: VPS provisioning patterns for Linux servers covering initial setup, firewall, nginx reverse proxy, SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt, systemd service management, and server hardening. Use whenever the project contains Ansible playbooks, shell provisioning scripts, nginx configs, systemd unit files, or certbot references, OR the user asks about VPS setup, server hardening, ufw, fail2ban, nginx reverse proxy, certbot, Let's Encrypt, systemd services, unattended-upgrades, even if VPS is not mentioned by name.

# VPS provisioning patterns

Targeting Debian 12 (Bookworm) and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Commands and package names are Debian/Ubuntu unless noted. Verify against your distribution's current docs.

## When to load this skill

- Project contains Ansible playbooks, Terraform configs, shell provisioning scripts
- Files contain nginx `server {}` blocks, certbot commands, systemd unit files
- `.service` files, `ufw allow` commands, `sshd_config` references
- User asks about VPS setup, SSH hardening, nginx config, Let's Encrypt, fail2ban, systemd, ufw, unattended-upgrades

## When not to load this skill

- Kubernetes cluster management (different abstraction layer)
- Cloud-managed services where the OS is not directly accessible (PaaS, Lambda)
- Windows Server administration
