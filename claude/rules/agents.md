# Agents

Subagent shells live under `$HOME/.claude/agents/`. The canonical inventory is `/agents` output.

## Spawn discipline

A subagent costs its own request budget, so default to doing the work directly. Spawn one only when the task matches an agent's specialty, needs isolation from the main context (a broad sweep, a read-only audit), or genuinely parallelizes across independent items. Spawn `Explore` only past 5 unresolved queries, not 3.

An agent finishes its own task rather than spawning further subagents. Nested spawning is allowed only from a specialized agent, for a sub-task outside its own tool grant, at most one per invocation.

## Model and effort pins

Pin `model:` or `effort:` frontmatter only when it diverges from the session default; `doctor.sh` flags a redundant pin. A skill may set `model:` or `effort:`, never both (Claude Code drops the model override when both are present on a skill). A skill forks (`context: fork`) only to carry a `model:` pin or to name an `agent:`.

## Forked decision protocol

1. A forked skill has no AskUserQuestion tool.
2. A step that would ask instead stops and returns the question(s) and options under a `## Needs decision` heading.
3. On a task-notification carrying that heading, ask via AskUserQuestion in the main conversation, then resume the same agent via SendMessage with the answer(s).

## Verify agent-claimed work before building on it

An agent's report describes what it intended, not necessarily what it did. Before committing, reporting, or handing a claim to another agent: claimed edits get a `git diff --stat` on the touched paths; claimed findings get one cited `file:line` spot-checked.

## Agent shell boilerplate

Every agent definition assumes these three, so no agent file restates them:

- **Startup**: repo context and the `<required-skills>`/`<suggested-skills>` blocks arrive via the `SubagentStart` hook (`inject-subagent-context.sh`), independent of the agent's tool grants. Agents that need no repo context (`checker`, `researcher`) ignore the block.
- **Read-only boundary**: Edit and Write exist only for memory and a scratch report. Never touch project source; state fixes as instructions.
- **Output**: follow the invoking skill's format and path. Long output goes to a named scratch path plus a short digest.
