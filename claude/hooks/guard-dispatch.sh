# PreToolUse hook for Edit, Write, MultiEdit. Runs guard-edit's, guard-skills'
# and guard-tone's checks in one process against one payload read, instead of
# three processes each re-parsing it. Mirrors format-dispatch.sh's role on
# the PostToolUse side.
#
# Order matches the old settings.json registration: edit-safety, skills-gate,
# tone. A call violating more than one check now surfaces only the first
# violation's message instead of one per hook - the call is still correctly
# blocked either way.

# _lib.sh's ERR trap is process-wide: left in place, an unexpected error in
# ANY one check would fail open the whole dispatcher, skipping the remaining
# checks - a real isolation loss vs. three separate processes. Clear it and
# give each check its own errexit+errtrace+trap inside its own subshell
# instead, restoring per-hook isolation. Verified empirically (clean check,
# internal-error check, blocking check) before writing this.
