#
# guard-dispatch.sh is the single PreToolUse hook wired to Edit|Write|
# MultiEdit in settings.json. It sources guard-edit.sh, guard-skills.sh, and
# guard-tone.sh once each and runs their run_guard_* functions in declared
# order (edit-safety, then skills-gate, then tone), each inside its own
# subshell with a fresh set -e/errtrace/ERR trap so one check's fail-open
# never masks a different check's genuine violation.
#
# Each test fakes $HOME so guard-skills.sh's _stacks.yml/skills.jsonl/cache
# reads never touch real machine state, same convention as guard-skills.bats.
#
# Run with: bats tests/

# isolate one specific check's failure from another's success -- but it does
# prove the dispatcher survives and fails open end-to-end instead of hanging
# or erroring out at the first broken check, printing a distinct

# the same bypass). Both must leave guard-skills.sh/guard-tone.sh running
